            This isn&apos;t your typical election predictionâ€”we use an all-new
            method to determine the outcomes of races down to the margin and
            break down exactly how our model made those conclusions. Produced by
            the Ivy League&apos;s largest political journal, this model takes
            data across multiple decades and works to explain how each
            race&apos;s history affects expected outcomes.
